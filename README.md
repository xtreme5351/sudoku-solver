# Sudoku Solver

An implementation of a backtracking algorithm, just to simply increase my understanding in the topic :)
It is completed.

# Usage

Build the program. 
Add 2 files in the same location as the executable to store the inputs and outputs  
The input has to be a 9x9 sudoku standard grid.  

Usage:
Example (Windows)  :
**sudokuSolver.exe {input file path} {output file path} {divider char}**

The divider character is to format the output and can be left empty.
e.g. "|" will put "|" between each number on the output board
